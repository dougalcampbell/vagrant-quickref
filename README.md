vagrant-quickref
================

Quick reference sheets for Vagrant commands. There are two files:
* `vagrant-quickref.md`: The compact version, minimal explanation.
* `vagrant-quickref-verbose.md`: The verbose version, explains each command

If you want to print from the GitHub rendered page for one of the files, 
you might want to check out this bookmarklet, which will remove a lot of 
the extra page decorations:

Paste the JavaScript snippet as a URL in browser bookmark, and put the 
bookmark on your toolbar. Visit any GitHub markdown file, click the 
bookmarklet in your toolbar, and print!

Pull-requests welcome!
